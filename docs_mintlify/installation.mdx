## Prerequisites

<Info>
Before installing **Timbal**, ensure you have:
- **Docker** installed and running: Check the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- **Python `3.11` or higher**: Make sure you have the correct version installed before proceeding.
</Info>

We recommend using `uv` for dependency management and package handling, streamlining project setup and execution for a seamless development experience.

<Info>
Install uv to manage your Python dependencies.

- On **macOS/Linux**:

  Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

  If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

  ```bash
  wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
  
- On **Windows**:

  Use `irm` to download the script and `iex` to execute it:

  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

If you run into any issues, refer to **[UV's installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/get-started/installation/)** guide for more information.
</Info>

## Install Timbal CLI

The **Timbal CLI** provides a command-line interface for managing Timbal projects, including initialization, building, deploying, and other project management tasks.

### macOS/Linux

Use `curl` to download and execute the installation script:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows

Use PowerShell to download and execute the installation script:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.ps1 | iex"
```

<Tip>
Once installed, you can use the `timbal` command to manage your projects!
</Tip>

## Install Timbal Python Package

If you want to use Timbal directly in your Python projects or integrate it into existing code, you can install the Python package directly.

### Basic Installation

You can install the Timbal Python package using either `uv` or `pip`:

```bash
uv add timbal
```

```bash
pip install timbal
```

### Optional Dependencies

Timbal also has **optional dependencies** for integrations (e.g., MySQL, Google Drive, etc.).
You can install all optional dependencies at once with:

```bash
pip install "timbal[all]"
```

```bash
uv add "timbal[all]"
```

Or, you can install only the integrations you need, for example:

```bash
pip install "timbal[mysql,gdrive]"
```

```bash
uv add "timbal[mysql,gdrive]"
```

We'll cover integrations in more detail in the [Integrations](/integrations) section.

For a complete and up-to-date list of supported extras you can also look at the `pyproject.toml` file on [GitHub](https://github.com/timbal-ai/timbal/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

<Tip>
You're ready to create your first Timbal project!
