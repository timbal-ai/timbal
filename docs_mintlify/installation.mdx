Timbal uses `uv` for python dependency management and package handling, streamlining project setup and execution for a seamless development experience.

<Info>
Install uv to manage your Python dependencies.

- On **macOS/Linux**:

  Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

  If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

  ```bash
  wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
  
- On **Windows**:

  Use `irm` to download the script and `iex` to execute it:

  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

If you run into any issues, refer to **[UV's installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/get-started/installation/)** guide for more information.
</Info>

## CLI

The **Timbal CLI** provides a command-line interface for managing Timbal projects, including initialization, building, deploying, and other project management tasks.

<Info>
Before installing the CLI, ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and running.
</Info>

**macOS/Linux**

Use `curl` to download and execute the installation script:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows**

Use PowerShell to download and execute the installation script:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.ps1 | iex"
```

<Tip>
Once installed, you can use the `timbal` command to manage your projects! You can skip to the [quickstart guide](./quickstart) to get started.
</Tip>

## Python Package

If you want to use Timbal directly in your Python projects or integrate it into an existing codebase, you can install the Python package directly.

<Info>
Before adding the package, ensure you have `python>=3.11` installed.
</Info>

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv add timbal
```

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install timbal
```

Alternatively, if you want the latest changes and want to experiment with beta features, you can clone the repository and install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timbal-ai/timbal.git
cd timbal
uv add -e . # pip install -e .
```
