The Timbal API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 
In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (_e.g._, a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Timbal servers (these are rare).


| Code | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | Everything worked as expected. |
| 400<br/>422 | Bad Requests | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |
| 402 | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn’t exist. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500<br/>502<br/>503<br/>504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on our end. |
