The Timbal API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Unlike traditional APIs that offer a single _test mode_ or _sandbox_, the Timbal Platform empowers you with unlimited deployment flexibility through versioning. 
Every resource you create automatically supports versioning, similar to Git's branching and commit system. You can create new versions of your agents, workflows, and knowledge bases, then seamlessly navigate between versions, roll back changes, or branch off in different directions. 
Each version of your agents, workflows, and knowledge bases can be configured with its own environment variables, permissions, and settingsâ€”allowing you to seamlessly manage development, staging, production, or any custom configuration that suits your deployment pipeline.
