## What are Agents?

Agents are autonomous execution units that **orchestrate LLM interactions with tool calling**. 

Without tools, an agent functions as a basic LLM. The simplest agent requires just a name and model:

```python
from timbal import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="openai/gpt-5"
)  # That's it! You've created your first agent!
```

## Model Providers

You can specify any model using the "provider/model" format. See all supported models in [Model Capabilities](/getting-started/model_capabilities).

Some models require specific parameters (like `max_tokens` for Claude). Use `model_params` to pass any additional model configuration: 

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="claude_agent",
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-latest",
    model_params={
        "max_tokens": 1024
    }
)
```

**Note:** Make sure to define all required environment variables—such as the API key model that you need—in your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
```

Define tools as Python functions - the framework handles schema generation, parameter validation, and execution orchestration.
