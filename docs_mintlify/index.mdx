## Overview

**Timbal is an open-source framework for designing autonomous AI applications with flexible orchestration, real-time streaming, and multi-provider support.**

Timbal empowers developers with both **high-level simplicity** and **precise low-level control**, ideal for creating autonomous AI applications tailored to any scenario.

Timbal provides two main patterns for building AI applications:

- **[Agents](./agents)**: Agents are autonomous execution units that orchestrate LLM interactions with tool calling. 
  
  Best for:
  - Complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple steps
  - Dynamic tool selection based on context
  - Open-ended problem solving with autonomous decision making
  - Multi-turn conversations with memory across iterations

  ```python 
  from timbal import Agent

  agent = Agent(
      name="my_agent",
      model="openai/gpt-4.1",
      tools=[search_web],
  )
  ```

- **[Workflows](./workflows)**: Fine-grained control over your AI pipeline with explicit step-by-step execution. 
  
  Best for:
  - Complex data processing pipelines with multiple stages
  - Predictable processes with defined execution paths
  - Performance-critical applications requiring concurrent execution
  - Workflows where explicit control over step dependencies is needed

  ```python
  from timbal import Workflow

  workflow = (WorkFlow(name="my_workflow")
      .step(extract_text)
      .step(text_processor, raw_text=extract_text.output)
      .step(convert_to_database, text=text_processor.output, chunk_size=1000)
  )
  ```

## Why are we building this?

- **Simplicity over complexity**: Unlike LangGraph, CrewAI, and other frameworks that abstract away what's really happening, Timbal keeps things transparent. Under the hood, it's just LLM calls and async function execution - no hidden magic, no opaque abstractions.

- **Developer experience first**: We believe you shouldn't need to learn a new mental model to build AI applications. If you understand functions and async/await from any modern programming language, you understand Timbal. Most agents are built in 10-20 lines of code.

- **Battle-tested architecture**: Our core abstractions have been refined through real-world production usage. The framework is designed around proven patterns: async generators, Pydantic validation, and event-driven processing.

- **Robust interfaces**: Strong typing and validation make it nearly impossible to break things from the outside, while clean abstractions make internal modifications straightforward. The framework fails fast with clear error messages.

- **Performance by design**: Built for production workloads with concurrent execution, efficient memory management, and minimal overhead. Every design decision prioritizes speed and scalability.

- **Stability in a chaotic ecosystem**: Providers change APIs monthly. Timbal provides a stable abstraction that shields your applications in production.
