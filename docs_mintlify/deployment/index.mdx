Deploying AI agents to production requires careful consideration of infrastructure, scalability, and operational requirements. Timbal provides enterprise-grade deployment options designed to meet diverse organizational needs and technical constraints.

From fully managed cloud deployments to self-hosted infrastructure, choose the approach that aligns with your security, compliance, and operational requirements.

**Fully managed, zero-configuration deployment**

The easiest way to deploy your Timbal agents. Simply upload your project and we handle everything - scaling, monitoring, security, and maintenance.

- **Zero DevOps**: No servers, containers, or infrastructure to manage
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Built-in monitoring**: Real-time metrics and logging
- **Secure by default**: HTTPS, authentication, and compliance built-in
- **Configurable resources**: Choose specific machines or instances for your workload
- **Fast deployment**: Go live in minutes

<h3>Self-Hosted with Docker</h3>
**Complete control over your infrastructure**

Use `timbal build` to generate a production-ready Docker container that you can deploy anywhere Docker runs.

- **Full control**: Your infrastructure, your rules
