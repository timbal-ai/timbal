Agents can analyze EML files to extract key information and provide summaries. First validate your EML file with Timbal's `File` type, then pass it alongside text in a list:

```python
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.types.file import File

agent = Agent(
    name="EmailSummarizer",
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    system_prompt="Summarize emails and extract key information like sender, subject, main points, and action items."
)

# Validate EML file and summarize
eml_file = File.validate("path/to/email.eml")
result = await agent(
    prompt=["Summarize this email and extract the key points", eml_file]
).collect()

print(result.output.content[0].text)
```

## Key Features

- **Email Summarization**: Extract key information from email content
- **Structured Analysis**: Identify sender, subject, main points, and action items
- **File Support**: Works with local files, URLs, and base64 data
