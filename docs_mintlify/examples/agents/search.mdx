Agents can search the web for current information using built-in search tools. Add the search tool to your agent's tools list:

```python
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.handlers.perplexity.search import search

agent = Agent(
    name="SearchAgent",
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    tools=[search],
    system_prompt="Search the web for current information and provide accurate answers."
)

# Agent will automatically use search when needed
result = await agent(
    prompt="When was the last match of Liverpool?"
).collect()
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time Information**: Access current web data and news
- **Automatic Tool Selection**: Agent decides when to search
- **Citation Support**: Includes source links in responses
