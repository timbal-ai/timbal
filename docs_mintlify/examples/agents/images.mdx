Agents automatically handle image files when included in prompts. First validate your image file with Timbal's `File` type, then pass it alongside text in a list:

```python
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.types.file import File

agent = Agent(
    name="VisionAgent",
    model="anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",  # Vision-capable model
    model_params={"max_tokens": 256},
    system_prompt="Analyze images and provide detailed descriptions."
)

# Validate multiple image files and analyze
image1 = File.validate("path/to/image1.jpg")
image2 = File.validate("path/to/image2.png")
image3 = File.validate("path/to/image3.jpeg")

result = await agent(
    prompt=["Analyze these images and provide a description of each one", image1, image2, image3]
).collect()

print(result.output.content[0].text)
```

<Warning>
Use vision-capable models for image processing. Check [Model Capabilities](/model_capabilities) to see which models support image input.
</Warning>

## Key Features

- **Automatic Processing**: Images are automatically converted to the correct format for vision models
- **Multi-modal**: Combine text and images in the same conversation
- **File Support**: Works with local files, URLs, and base64 data
