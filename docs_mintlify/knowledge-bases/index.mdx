<Info>
**Knowledge Bases are only available in the Timbal Platform.** 

You must create your Knowledge Base from the [Timbal Platform](https://platform.timbal.ai), and a valid API key is required to access it.

Throughout this documentation, any references to `org_id` and `kb_id` refer to the identifiers provided by the Timbal Platform for your organization and knowledge base.

## What is a Knowledge Base?

Think of a Knowledge Base as a smart database that combines the best of both worlds:

### Traditional Database Capabilities
- Store structured data in organized tables (like spreadsheets)
- Query data with precise SQL commands
- Maintain data relationships and integrity
- Import data from files or add it programmatically

### AI-Powered Intelligence
- Search using natural language ("Find documents about API integration")
- Understand context and meaning, not just exact words
- Find similar content automatically
- Learn from your data patterns

## The Three Building Blocks

Knowledge Bases are built on three core components that work together:

### 1. Tables

Think of tables as organized filing cabinets. Each table is like a cabinet with labeled drawers (columns) where you store specific types of information.

**Example**: A "Products" table might have drawers for:
- Product name
- Description  
- Price
- Category
- Stock quantity

### 2. Embeddings

Embeddings are like giving your data a "brain" that understands meaning. They convert text into mathematical representations that capture the essence of what the text is about.

**How it works**: 
- "Laptop computer" and "portable PC" get similar mathematical representations
- "Customer support" and "help desk" are recognized as related concepts
- Natural language queries find relevant content even without exact matches

### 3. Indexes

Indexes are like the index at the back of a book - they help you find information quickly without reading every page. They create fast pathways to your data.

**Types of speed boosts**:
- **B-tree indexes**: Fast lookups for names, dates, numbers
- **Hash indexes**: Lightning-fast exact matches
- **GIN indexes**: Powerful text search capabilities
- **Composite indexes**: Optimized for complex queries

## The Knowledge Base Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Data Structure">
    Plan what information you want to store and how it should be organized.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Tables">
    Set up the structure for your data with appropriate columns and data types.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Your Data">
    Add your information from files, databases, or programmatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable AI Search">
    Create embeddings on text columns to enable semantic search capabilities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Performance">
    Add indexes to ensure fast queries as your data grows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search and Discover">
    Use Timbal's search interface, API, or AI agents to find relevant content.
