<#
.SYNOPSIS
Installer for the Timbal CLI.

.DESCRIPTION
This script installs the Timbal Command Line Interface (CLI).
It detects the host architecture (Windows x86_64 or aarch64), downloads the appropriate
Timbal executable from the latest GitHub release, and installs it to:
    $env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\timbal.exe

The script then adds the installation directory ($env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin)
to the user's PATH environment variable, making the 'timbal' command available
in the terminal.

This script requires PowerShell 5 or later and an appropriate Execution Policy
(e.g., RemoteSigned, Bypass).

.PARAMETER Help
Displays this help message.
