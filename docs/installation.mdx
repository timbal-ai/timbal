## Installation methods

The **Timbal CLI** provides a command-line interface for managing Timbal projects, including initialization, building, deploying, and other project management tasks.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    Use `curl` to download and execute the installation script:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://timbal.ai/install.sh | sh
    ```

    If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    ```bash
    wget -qO- https://timbal.ai/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Use PowerShell to download and execute the installation script:

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://timbal.ai/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
The installation script may be inspected before use:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://timbal.ai/install.sh | less
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    irm https://timbal.ai/install.ps1 | less
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, the installer or binaries can be downloaded directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/timbal-ai/timbal/releases).
</Tip>

## Upgrading

To upgrade the CLI to the latest version, you can either run:

```bash
timbal upgrade
```

Or re-run the installation script:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://timbal.ai/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://timbal.ai/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Uninstallation

To remove the CLI, delete the binary and the `~/.timbal` data directory:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    rm ~/.local/bin/timbal
    rm -rf ~/.timbal
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin\timbal.exe"
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.timbal"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Python Package

If you want to use Timbal directly in your Python projects or integrate it into an existing codebase, you can install the Python package directly.

<Info>
Before adding the package, ensure you have `python>=3.11` installed.
</Info>

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install timbal
```

Or with `uv`:

```bash
uv add timbal
```

Alternatively, if you want the latest changes and want to experiment with beta features, you can clone the repository and install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timbal-ai/timbal.git
cd timbal
pip install -e .
```
