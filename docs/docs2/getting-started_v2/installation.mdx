Step-by-step instructions for setting up Timbal CLI and Python package.

## Prerequisites

:::info[Requirements]{.tight-admonition}
Before installing **Timbal**, ensure you have:
- **Docker** installed and running: Check the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- **Python 3.12 or higher**: Make sure you have the correct version installed before proceeding.
:::

We recommend using `uv` for dependency management and package handling, streamlining project setup and execution for a seamless development experience.

:::note[Recommendation]
Install uv to manage your Python dependencies.

- On **macOS/Linux**:

  Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

  <CodeBlock language="bash" code ={`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`}/>

  If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code ={`wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`}/>
- On **Windows**:

  Use `irm` to download the script and `iex` to execute it:
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code ={`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`}/>

If you run into any issues, refer to **[UV's installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/get-started/installation/)** guide for more information.

## Install Timbal CLI

The **Timbal CLI** provides a command-line interface for managing Timbal projects, including initialization, building, deploying, and other project management tasks.

### macOS/Linux

Use `curl` to download and execute the installation script:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.sh | sh`}/>

### Windows

Use PowerShell to download and execute the installation script:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.ps1 | iex"`}/>

:::success[CLI Ready]
Once installed, you can use the `timbal` command to manage your projects!
:::

## Install Timbal Python Package

If you want to use Timbal directly in your Python projects or integrate it into existing code, you can install the Python package directly.

### Basic Installation

You can install the Timbal Python package using either `uv` or `pip`:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`uv add timbal`}/>
<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pip install timbal`}/>

### Optional Dependencies

Timbal also has **optional dependencies** for integrations (e.g., MySQL, Google Drive, etc.).
You can install all optional dependencies at once with:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pip install "timbal[all]"`}/>
<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`uv add "timbal[all]"`}/>

Or, you can install only the integrations you need, for example:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pip install "timbal[mysql,gdrive]"`}/>

We'll cover integrations in more detail in the [Integrations](/integrations) section.

For a complete and up-to-date list of supported extras you can also look at the `pyproject.toml` file on [GitHub](https://github.com/timbal-ai/timbal/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

You're ready to create your first Timbal project!
