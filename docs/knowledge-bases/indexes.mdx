## What are Indexes?

**Indexes** are data structures that improve query performance by creating optimized access paths to your data:

- **Speed up queries** - Find data faster instead of scanning entire tables
- **Enable advanced searches** - Support complex search patterns and operations
- **Optimize specific use cases** - Different index types for different needs
- **Trade-off storage for speed** - Use extra storage to achieve faster queries

## Index Types

Timbal supports several PostgreSQL index types, each optimized for different use cases:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="B-tree (btree)" icon="tree" href="#">
    Best for equality and range queries on sortable data, _e.g._ IDs, dates, names, prices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hash" icon="hash" href="#">
    Optimized for exact equality comparisons, _e.g._ status codes, categories.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)" icon="tree" href="#">
    Good for full-text search, arrays, and JSON data, _e.g._ long texts, tags, metadata.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GiST (Generalized Search Tree)" icon="tree" href="#">
    Good for geometric data, full-text search, and nearest-neighbor searches, _e.g._ locations, nearest neighbors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="BRIN (Block Range Index)" icon="tree" href="#">
    Efficient for very large tables where data has natural clustering, _e.g._ time series, log data.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Creating Indexes

<Info>
**Only create indexes for columns you actually query** - unnecessary indexes waste storage and slow down writes
</Info>

```python
from timbal.platform.kbs.indexes import create_index

# Create a basic B-tree index on a single column
await create_index(
    org_id="your-org-id",
    kb_id="your-kb-id",
    table_name="Users",
    name="idx_users_email",        # Index name
    column_names=["email"],        # Columns to index
    type="btree",                  # Index type
    is_unique=True                 # Enforce uniqueness
)
```

<Info>
**Index names must be unique across your entire knowledge base** - two different tables cannot have indexes with the same name
</Info>

### Composite Indexes

```python
# Create a composite index on multiple columns
await create_index(
    org_id="your-org-id",
    kb_id="your-kb-id",
    table_name="Orders",
    name="idx_orders_customer_date",
    column_names=["customer_id", "order_date"],  # Multiple columns
    type="btree",
    is_unique=False
)
```

**Column order is critical:** Put the most selective columns first (columns with many unique values) before less selective ones.

- **High selectivity** = Many unique values (user_id, email, timestamps)
- **Low selectivity** = Few unique values (status, boolean flags, categories)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Example">
    ```python
    # user_id eliminates most rows immediately
    ["user_id", "status", "created_at"]
    ```
    `user_id` has thousands of unique values, so the database can quickly narrow down to just a few rows.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Poor Example">
    ```python
    # status only eliminates ~50% of rows
    ["status", "user_id", "created_at"]
    ```
    `status` might only have 2-3 values (active/inactive), so the database still has to scan millions of rows.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Composite indexes can only be used from left to right** - you can't skip the first columns.

Given an index `["customer_id", "order_date", "status"]`:

**These queries work efficiently:**
```sql
WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date > '2024-01-01' AND status = 'shipped'
WHERE customer_id = 123
WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date > '2024-01-01'
```

**These queries won't be as efficient:**
```sql
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01'  -- skips first column
WHERE order_date = '2024-01-01' AND customer_id = 123  -- wrong order
```
</Info>

<Tip>
See the [API Reference](/api-reference/knowledge-bases/indexes/list) for endpoints to **list, delete, monitor, and configure** indexes to help you manage them as your data grows.
