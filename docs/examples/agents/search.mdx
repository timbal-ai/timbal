```python
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.tools import WebSearch

# Works with OpenAI or Anthropic models
agent = Agent(
    name="SearchAgent",
    model="openai/gpt-5.1",
    tools=[WebSearch()],
    system_prompt="Search the web for current information."
)

# Agent will automatically use search when needed
result = await agent(
    prompt="When was the last match of Liverpool?"
).collect()
```

## Key Features
