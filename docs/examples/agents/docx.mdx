Agents automatically handle DOCX files when included in prompts. First validate your DOCX file with Timbal's `File` type, then pass it alongside text in a list:

```python
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.types.file import File

agent = Agent(
    name="DocumentAgent",
    model="gemini/gemini-2.5-pro",
    system_prompt="Analyze Word documents and extract key information."
)

# Validate DOCX file and analyze
docx_file = File.validate("path/to/document.docx")
result = await agent(
    prompt=["Summarize this document and highlight the main sections", docx_file]
).collect()

print(result.output.collect_text())
```

## Key Features

- **Automatic Processing**: DOCX files are automatically parsed and converted to readable format
- **Document Analysis**: Extract text, structure, and insights from Word documents
- **File Support**: Works with local files, URLs, and base64 data
