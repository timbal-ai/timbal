---

Agents can automatically include real-time data in their system prompts using dynamic functions. This ensures responses are always current and contextually relevant:

```python
from timbal import Agent
from datetime import datetime

# Custom function to get current time
def get_current_time():
    """Get current date and time."""
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Create agent with dynamic system prompt
agent = Agent(
    name="TimeAgent",
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt="""You are a helpful assistant with access to current time information.

Current context:
- Time: {__main__::get_current_time}

Use this information to provide accurate, time-aware responses."""
)

# Agent automatically includes live data in responses
result = await agent(
    prompt="What time is it right now?"
).collect()
```

## Key Features

- **Live Data Integration**: Automatically fetch and include real-time information
- **Automatic Updates**: System prompt refreshes with current data on each run
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to add custom functions for any data source
- **Performance**: Template resolution is fast and cached for efficiency
