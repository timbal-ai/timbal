Agents automatically handle CSV files when included in prompts. First validate your CSV file with Timbal's `File` type, then pass it alongside text in a list:

```python
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.types.file import File

agent = Agent(
    name="DataAgent",
    model="openai/gpt-5",
    system_prompt="Analyze CSV data and provide insights."
)

# Validate CSV file and analyze
csv_file = File.validate("path/to/data.csv")
result = await agent(
    prompt=["What insights can you find in this data?", csv_file]
).collect()

print(result.output.content[0].text)
```

## Key Features

- **Automatic Processing**: CSV files are automatically parsed and converted to the correct format
- **Data Analysis**: Extract insights, patterns, and summaries from structured data
- **File Support**: Works with local files, URLs, and base64 data
