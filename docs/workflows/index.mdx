## What Are Workflows?

Workflows are programmable execution pipelines that **orchestrate step-by-step processing with explicit control flow**.
The following line creates an empty workflow, ready for steps to be added:

```python 
from timbal import Workflow

workflow = Workflow(name="my_workflow")
```

## Building Blocks of a Workflow: Steps

Steps are the core units of work, which can process data, perform actions and pass results onward.

### Adding Steps to the Workflow

Use `.step()` to add steps to workflows. **Any Runnable is valid to create a step**.

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius: float) -> float:
    return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

def check_threshold(temperature: float, threshold: float) -> str:
    return "Alert!" if temperature > threshold else "Normal"
    
workflow = (Workflow(name="temperature_alert")
    .step(celsius_to_fahrenheit, celsius=35)
    .step(check_threshold, temperature=80, threshold=lambda: 85)
)
```

### Step Names and Reusing Functions

**Each step in a workflow must have a unique name**. Like all Runnables, steps are identified by their names, which must be distinct within the workflow.

To use the same function multiple times in a workflow, wrap it in a new Tool with a distinct name for each usage:

```python
# Create a Tool to reuse the function
threshold_checker_tool = Tool(
    name="threshold_checker",
    handler=check_threshold
)

workflow = (Workflow(name="temperature_monitoring", temperature=80)
    .step(celsius_to_fahrenheit, celsius=35)
    .step(check_threshold, threshold=lambda: 85)
    .step(threshold_checker_tool, threshold=lambda: 100)
)
```

## Running the Workflow

The workflow's final output is automatically determined by the **last executed step** in the dependency graph. 
To run the workflow and receive directly the final output, use the `collect()` method:

```python
result = await workflow().collect()
print(result.output)  # Output from the final executed step
```

However, you can also **stream all events** as they happen:
```python
async for event in workflow():
    print(event)
```

The input and output from each step is stored in its Run Context, accessible via:

- **`.input`**: Dictionary of parameters passed to the step
- **`.output`**: Value(s) returned by the step. Can be a single value, dictionary, array, or custom class.

You can also store additional custom variables:

```python
from timbal.state import get_run_context

async def process_user_data(user_id: str):
    # New variable saved in the step context:
    get_run_context().current_span().user_status = "active"
    return f"Processed user: {user_id}"
```



## Key Features
- **Composition**: Workflows can contain other workflows
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent steps run concurrently
- **Type Safety**: Automatic parameter validation via Pydantic
- **Error Isolation**: Failed steps skip dependents, others continue
