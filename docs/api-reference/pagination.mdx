The Timbal API uses **cursor-based pagination** with page tokens for efficient navigation through large collections.

## Making Requests

**Initial request:**
```http
GET /apps
```

**Subsequent requests:**
When a response includes a `next_page_token`, use it as the `page_token` query parameter:
```http
GET /apps?page_token=eyJpZCI6IjEyMyIsInRzIjoxNjk...
```

<Tip>
Page tokens are opaque stringsâ€”never parse or modify them.
