In this quickstart guide we're going to see how to build an AI agent with Timbal. We'll start from scratch and gradually enhance it with advanced features. Let's dive in!

Before moving forward, ensure you've completed the [installation steps](/installation).

## Create a Timbal Project

Run the following Timbal CLI command to create a new project:

```bash
timbal create my-project
```

This will prompt you interactively to choose what you want to build (Agent or Workflow) and what UI you want for your project. After making your selections, it creates a project structure with all the necessary files and dependencies to get started.

### Project Structure

After running the command, your project will look like this:

```
my-project/
├── api/              - Elysia API server (Bun)
├── workforce/        - Your timbal components (Python)
│   └── <name>/
│       ├── agent.py  - Main app logic (or workflow.py for workflows)
│       ├── timbal.yaml    - Timbal configuration
│       └── pyproject.toml - Python dependencies
├── ui/               - React + Vite + TypeScript + shadcn (Bun) [optional]
├── .gitignore        - Git ignore file
└── README.md         - Project documentation
```

| Directory/File | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **api/** | Elysia API server running on Bun |
| **workforce/** | Your timbal components (Python). Contains subdirectories for each agent or workflow |
| **workforce/\<name\>/agent.py** | Main application file where you define your AI agents.<br/>If you create a workflow, you'll have a `workflow.py` file instead |
| **workforce/\<name\>/pyproject.toml** | Python project configuration and dependency management |
| **workforce/\<name\>/timbal.yaml** | Timbal deployment configuration and settings |
| **ui/** | React + Vite + TypeScript + shadcn running on Bun (only if UI is selected) |

<Tip>
You have your project structure set up. Next, you only need to edit the `agent.py` file (or `workflow.py` for workflows) in the `workforce/<name>/` directory to customize your agent's behavior and capabilities.
</Tip>

## Build a simple Agent

Let's create a simple agent with the `Agent` class:

```python agent.py icon="python"
from timbal import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="openai/gpt-5-mini"
)
```

<Info>
You'll need to set the appropriate environment variables for your chosen model (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`). Store these in a `.env` file and never commit them to version control.
</Info>

We can add the following boilerplate to our script to interact with the agent in the terminal:

```python
async def main():
    while True:
        prompt = input("User: ")
        if prompt == "q":
            break
        agent_output_event = await agent(prompt=prompt).collect()
        print(f"Agent: {agent_output_event.output}") # noqa: T201

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

You can learn more about the Agent class and all the available options in the [Agents](/agents) section.

<Tip>
You've just created your first Timbal agent. Next, you can add any type of tools to it to make it more powerful.
</Tip>

## Adding Tools

Agents become powerful with tools.
In Timbal, you can use both **baked-in tools** (pre-built and ready to use) and **custom tools** (functions you write yourself).

### Baked-in Tools

Timbal includes several ready-to-use tools. For example, the `WebSearch` tool allows your agent to search the internet for real-time information:

```python agent.py icon="python"
from timbal import Agent
from timbal.tools import WebSearch

agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="openai/gpt-5-mini",
    tools=[WebSearch()]
)
```

### Custom Tools

Creating custom tools is straightforward—just write a function. Here's a simple example that returns the current date and time:

```python agent.py icon="python"
from datetime import datetime

from timbal import Agent
from timbal.tools import WebSearch

def get_datetime() -> str:
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="openai/gpt-5-mini",
    tools=[WebSearch(), get_datetime]
)
```

You can combine any number of tools to create powerful, specialized agents. 
Mix and match baked-in and custom tools to fit your specific use case.
You can even use agents and workflows as tools!

<Tip>
**Congratulations!** You've built a fully functional AI agent with tools in just a few lines of code.
