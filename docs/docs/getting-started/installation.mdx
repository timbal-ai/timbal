# Installation

## CLI

Timbal CLI can be installed using the following methods:

### Unix-based Systems (Linux/macOS)

Use `curl` to download and execute the installation script:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.sh | sh`}/>

### Windows

Use PowerShell to download and execute the installation script:

<CodeBlock language="powershell" code={`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timbal-ai/timbal/main/cli/install.ps1 | iex"`}/>

:::info[Python Version Requirements]{.tight-admonition}
Before installing **Timbal CLI**, ensure you have:
- **Docker** installed and running: Check the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- **Python 3.12 or higher**: Make sure you have the correct version installed before proceeding.
:::

We recommend using `uv` for dependency management and package handling, streamlining project setup and execution for a seamless development experience.

:::note[Recommendation]
Install uv to manage your Python dependencies.

- On **macOS/Linux**:

  Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

  <CodeBlock language="bash" code ={`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`}/>

  If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code ={`wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`}/>
- On **Windows**:

  Use `irm` to download the script and `iex` to execute it:
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code ={`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`}/>

If you run into any issues, refer to **[UV's installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/get-started/installation/)** guide for more information.

## Install Timbal

You can install Timbal CLI using either `uv` or `pip`:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`uv add timbal`}/>
<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pip install timbal`}/>

Timbal also has **optional dependencies** for integrations (e.g., MySQL, Google Drive, etc.).
You can install all optional dependencies at once with:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pip install timbal[all]`}/>

Or, you can install only the integrations you need, for example:

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`pip install timbal[mysql,gdrive]`}/>

We'll cover integrations in more detail in the [Integrations](../integrations) section.

For a complete and up-to-date list of supported extras you can also look at the `pyproject.toml` file on [GitHub](https://github.com/timbal-ai/timbal/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
