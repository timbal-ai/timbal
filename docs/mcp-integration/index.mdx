## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open standard that enables communication between AI models and external tools and services.

By exposing **Timbal as an MCP server**, AI-powered editors and applications can interact with Timbal’s functionality directly.

## Connecting Timbal via MCP

To use Timbal with MCP, you first need to configure your editor or client to connect to Timbal’s MCP endpoint:

```
https://api.timbal.ai/mcp
```

<Note>
Each editor or client handles MCP connections differently. The following sections inside **Connecting Timbal** provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for connecting Timbal to specific editors and tools.
</Note>

Once the connection is configured, authentication is required to access Timbal’s features. An **active Timbal account** on the [Timbal Platform](https://app.timbal.ai) <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" size="10" /> is needed.

**Authentication** can be performed using one of the following methods:
- **OAuth** (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or Timbal OAuth)
- **API Key**

<Info>
See the [Authentication documentation](https://docs.timbal.ai/api-reference/authentication#authentication) for instructions on generating an API Key.
