## What are Skills?

Skills provide **domain-specific knowledge and tools** that agents can selectively activate based on user requests. 
Each skill is a module with its own documentation and tools that become accessible only when the skill is activated.
This is an extension of [Anthropic's Agent Skills](https://claude.com/blog/skills)


## How Skills Work

### Structure

Each skill is a directory containing:

- `SKILL.md` (required): Knowledge provided by the Skill
- `tools/` (optional): Folder for python files defining instances of skill-specific tools
- Supporting Files (optional): Additional documentation (must be referenced in `SKILL.md`)

Example structure:

```
skills/
└── payment_processing/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── fraud_detection.md
    ├── ...
    └── tools/
        ├── process_refund.py
        └── check_status.py
└── ...
```

### Loading Behavior

1. **Discovery**: The agent receives a list of available skills with their names and descriptions
2. **Activation**: When relevant to a user query, the agent loads the `SKILL.md` file and its associated tools
3. **Persistence**: Once loaded, skills remain available throughout the conversation

This lazy-loading approach keeps the agent's context efficient while ensuring specialized knowledge is available when needed.


## Using Skills

### Step 1: Enable Skills in Your Agent

Create a skills directory and configure your agent to use it:

```python highlight=6
from timbal import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
    skills_path="./skills"
)
```
The agent can now discover skills from this directory.

### Step 2: Create the SKILL.md File
Every skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter defining its name and description:

```markdown skills/payment_processing/SKILL.md
---
name: payment_processing
description: Complete payment processing including payments, refunds, and fraud detection
---

## Overview
There are different operations for e-commerce orders.

### Payment Policy
- Payments must be made within 30 days of order placement
- See `fraud_detection.md` for security guidelines

### Usage Guidelines
Always verify the order exists before processing payments or refunds.

### Escalation Process
If you cannot resolve an issue, escalate to the customer support team.
```

<Note> 
**Important**:  
The `name` and `description` fields are **required** in the YAML frontmatter. The agent uses these fields to decide when to activate the skill  
The `name` field must match the skill's directory name
</Note>


### Step 3: Add Tools (Optional)

Skills can provide specialized tools that only become available when the skill is used.

```python skills/payment_processing/tools/process_refund.py
from timbal import Tool

async def process_refund(order_id: str, amount: float, reason: str) -> str:
    """Process a customer refund."""
    # Your refund logic here
    return f"Refund of ${amount} processed for order {order_id}"

# Create the tool instance
process_refund_tool = Tool(
    name="process_refund",
    description="Process a refund for a customer order",
    handler=process_refund
)
```


### Step 4: Add Supporting Documentation (Optional)

For complex skills, include additional reference files and link to them in `SKILL.md`.
In the previous example, the `fraud_detection.md` file will only be read when the agent determines it is needed.

## Best Practices
- Each skill should have a single, well-defined purpose.
- Write clear descriptions. Agents use it to decide when to activate a Skill.
- Use descriptive names for the skill.



## Key Takeaways

- **Skills are modular packages** that combine knowledge and tools for specific domains
- **Dynamic loading** keeps agents efficient by loading only relevant capabilities
- **SKILL.md YAML frontmatter** defines the skill's identity and purpose
- **Tools and supporting documentation** are loaded on demand when the skill is activated
